# Cloud Design Patterns

This content articulates the benefit of applying patterns by showing how each piece can fit into cloud application architectures. It also discusses the benefits and considerations for each pattern. Most of the patterns have code samples or snippets that show how to implement the patterns using the features of Microsoft Azure. However, the majority of topics described in this guide are equally relevant to all kinds of distributed systems, whether hosted on Azure or on other cloud platforms.

Each pattern follows a common format that describes the context and problem, the solution, considerations for applying the pattern, and an example based on Azure. Each pattern also includes links to other related patterns.
